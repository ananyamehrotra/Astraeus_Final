## 🚀 Project Overview

### The Problem: Traffic Jam in the Sky
Modern satellite constellations face a critical bottleneck: thousands of satellites competing for limited ground station communication windows (10-15 minutes each). Current scheduling methods waste massive network capacity, leaving valuable data stranded in orbit.

### Our Solution: Project Entanglement
An AI-powered "Mission Control" system using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize satellite-ground station communication schedules. Our system learns through millions of simulated scenarios to discover truly optimal strategies, boosting network capacity by 15-25% without new hardware.
